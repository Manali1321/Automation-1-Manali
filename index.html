      <h3>Introduction Area:</h3>
      <p>Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.</p>

      <p>The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.</p>
        
      <p>Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool, it’s possible to record this test suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required.</p>
      <Unit>Unit testing is one of the most important areas to ensure code coverage and basic testing for the applications or software in today’s world.Unit testing is basically writing tests for business logic/code and is written by developers. Most of the good organizations ensure that unit testing coverage is in the higher 90s as the basic requirement.</p>
        
      <p>Automated unit testing tools are the need of the hour because a lot of crucial developer bandwidth goes into writing huge amounts of boilerplate code required for writing unit tests for all the pieces of application code.</p>

      <h3>Client Side Validation Testing Only:</h3>
      <p> The user input validation that takes place on the client side is called client-side validation. Scripting languages such as JavaScript and VBScript are used for client-side validation. In this kind of validation, all the user input validation is done in user’s browser only. It is not so secure like server-side validation because the hacker can easily bypass our client side scripting language and submit dangerous input to the server.</p>
      
      <p>Form validation can happen on the client side and the server side.

        Client side validation occurs using HTML5 attributes and client side JavaScript.</p>
        
      <p>You may have noticed that in some forms, as soon as you enter an invalid email address, the form gives an error "Please enter a valid email". This immediate type of validation is usually done via client side JavaScript.</p>
